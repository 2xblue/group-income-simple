## Before submitting an issue

- Read the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income-simple/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md) docs!
- Spend at least 5 seconds searching for existing open *or closed* issues.

## !! BEFORE BEGINNING DEVELOPMENT !!

If you're a designer or frontend developer, we recommend reading: __[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started-frontend.md)__

1. **Read the [Mileposts Methodology](https://github.com/taoeffect/mileposts)**
2. Look through all the [open issues](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income-simple/issues).
3. Look at the entire codebase.
4. Decide what you'd like to do, which will be either:
  - Create your own milepost (like [this one](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income-simple/issues/92))
  - Help out with an [existing milepost](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income-simple/labels/Milepost)
5. Double-check [with the current devs](https://gitter.im/okTurtles/group-income) to make sure everyone's on the same page.
6. Work in a **named branch** off of `master`, e.g. `yourname`, and submit any pull requests to `master` from that.

## Before submitting a pull request

- Make as few commits as possible for each pull request! If you've created a bunch, squash them into one and rebase on top of the latest `master` before submitting the PR.
- Before pushing any changes to the remote, __double-check__ and make sure your `master` is synced up with GitHub's `master`. If it's not, switch to it and `git pull`, then switch back to your branch and `git rebase` your commits on top of the latest `master`.

Then, submit a pull request with the changes in your named branch (e.g. for me it's `greg`) to `master`.
