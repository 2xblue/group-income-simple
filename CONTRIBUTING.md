## Before submitting an issue

- Read the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income-simple/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md) docs!
- Spend at least 5 seconds searching for existing issues.

## Before beginning development

- If you don't have repo write rights, create a fork.
- **Work in a named branch off of `master`, e.g. `yourname`**

## Before submitting a pull request

- Make as few commits as possible for each pull request! If you've created a bunch, squash them into one and rebase on top of the latest `master` before submitting the PR.
- Before pushing any changes to the remote, __double-check__ and make sure your `master` is synced up with GitHub's `master`. If it's not, switch to it and `git pull`, then switch back to your branch and `git rebase` your commits on top of the latest `master`.

Then, submit a pull request with the changes in your named branch (e.g. for me it's `greg`) to `master`.
