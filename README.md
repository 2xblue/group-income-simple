[Group Income](http://groupincome.org/) is a fair income sharing mechanism that allows groups to provide their members a minimum income.

Its accounting system can be implemented using a simple Excel spreadsheet, or on blockchains like Ethereum (which is [where we're headed](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income)). This centralized "Simple Edition" of Group Income is our way to rapidly prototype, develop, and research the concept with real groups.

## Contributing

#### Read first!

- **[:book: CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (required reading to send a PR!)**
- [:book: Getting Started â€” Modern frontend concepts & project overview](docs/Getting-Started-frontend.md)

#### Basic workflow

Run all servers + watch files for changes:

```
grunt dev
```

- After running `grunt dev`, visit the website: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Build the app for distribution:

```
grunt dist
```

Clean up files in `dist/` and the `sqlite.db` file (which will be better handled in the future):

```
grunt clean
```

Run the tests:

```
grunt test
```
